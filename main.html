		<h1>Ladakh</h1><br>
		<p>Ladakh is located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the humble land of Ladakh in India is cradled by the ice-capped Kunlun mountain range in the north and the Great Himalayas to the south, providing a breathtaking panoramic view all around.Due to extreme weather conditions which see temperatures plummet to minus 35 degree Celsius, the area remains scarcely populated, resulting in a clean and pristine environment. Once you land in Ladakh, you feel miles away from home; you could be at the very gates of heaven. Clear blue skies, wide landscapes of cold desert, ice-capped mountains and the soft cold mountain breeze against your skin makes you feel cradled in nature’s arms.Ladakh is well known as the ‘Land of the Gompas’ (or monasteries). Historically the region is of Tibetan descent and host to many Buddhist monasteries. Most famed are Thiksay, Hemis, Shey and Dhankar. The monasteries house several Buddhists who spend their entire life studying and learning.</p>
